# Differential gene expression, GO enrichment and correlation analysis of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with Enriched marine oils supplements 

# Overview: 

To establish the relationship between enriched marine oil supplement dose, peripheral specialized pro-resolving mediators (**SPM**) and cellular responses, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted. From blood, SPM (LC-MS/MS-based profiling) and gene expression (RNA Seq) profiles were obtained.  

This repository contains the **R scripts** used to run differential gene expression (DEG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the RNA Seq data. It also contains the script used to run **Spearman correlations** between SMP concentrations vs cell response, and SMP concentrations and marine oil supplement dose. 

Pathway analysis were performed uploading the differential expressed genes obtained from the previous analysis in [**KEGG**](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and [**Reactome**](https://reactome.org/) pathway databases.
